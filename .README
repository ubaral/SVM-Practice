					   CODE AND FILES SUMMARY
========================================================================
---------------------------------
"output.csv" and "spamOutput.csv"
---------------------------------
	These two files are the output of the test results that were submitt-
	ed to kaggle and the files that the scored are from.
	
--------------------------
"linearKernel_svm_plot.py"
--------------------------
	The Script used to generate the plots in Problem 1. Using th SVM
	with linear kernel provided by python scikit-learn.

--------------------------
"plot_confusion_matrix.py"
--------------------------
	This script is used to generate the confusion matrices from Problem
	2. It is hard coded in because I just generated the matrices during
	the execution of the alogrithm and then used that formatting to plug
	them into pyplot.

-----------------------------
"ten_fold_crossValidation.py"
-----------------------------
	This program is the implementation of ten-fold cross validation as
	specified in Problem 3.

--------------------------------
"classifierWithExtraFeatures.py"
--------------------------------
	The is the Digit Classifier I used for my Kaggle Submission with
	addidtional cool features. For example, it recognizes loops in the
	images and other things.

----------------
"SpamDataset.py"
----------------
	The Script used to do cross Validation for the spam dataset given
	to us. Partitions into twelve chunks and does 12-fold cross
	validation.

-----------------
"classForSpam.py"
-----------------
	This script runs the classifier on the optimum c value we found,
	which was 10, and spits the results to the output csv file.
	Which was then uploaded to kaggle.

**SIDE NOTE************************************************************
***********************************************************************
The directory "LaTex Writeup/" contains the source files for my writeup
of the homework including the final compiled pdf. It also has
the graphics files I exported from ppyplot. like the confusion matrices
and plot from Problem 1.
